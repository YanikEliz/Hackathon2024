# Hackathon2024
Code for a simple log-in system!

We had two hours to code this question on the day of the Hackathon.
I worked on the code alone and this is what I got.
All requirements and reach goals were met for the challenge proposed by an ASRC engineer.
Personal next steps is to transform code for use as access to my Raspberry Pi remotely and securely.
